### Oct.8_Lab: Block Chain System

In this subtask, a primitive Block Chain system is established. The program is capable of reading transaction datasets and organizing transactions into linked lists. The system can spot invalid transactions.

**Keywords: I/O stream, Organize transactions into Linked-Lists, Spotting invalid transactions. **

### Oct.13_Lab: Stack-based smart contracts.

In this subtask, the Block Chain system spots invalid transactions through RSA encryption examination, forming stack-based smart contracts.

**Keywords: RSA encryption, Signature, Stack-based smart contracts. **

### Oct.27_Lab: Interactive Block Chain System

In this subtask, a client can make transaction and inquiry messages to two Block Chain servers. The client-server communications are realized through I/O stream.

**Keywords: Block Chain transaction/inquiry system, Client-Server messaging, I/O stream.**

### Dec.1_Lab: Block Chain Analysis

Finally, the Block Chain system features include information query, big data analysis, finding the shortest path between two accounts, and checking possible ring structures in the account network.

**Keywords: Information query, Big data analysis, Graph algorithms, Shortest path, Topological sorting.**
